# Explanation
prj1.exe and input.txt are for the first program 
The first value is the node Value and the second Value is the Frequency in input.txt 
And the rule is: The frequency of the parents must be higher than the frequency of the children. 
According to this rule, we did BST in the first program

myprog.exe and input2.txt is for second program
In input2.txt there are just node values
We take it frequences as 0 initially.
As the user input some numbers which is located in BST
We rotates node according the rule that Parents' freq must be higher than child's.
